## Statement

The objective of the case study focuses on the application of the knowledge acquired during the course, both in the theory lectures and in the practical classes. For this purpose, the prototype designed for the third practical block is requested to be taken up and implemented.
The project will be carried out in three phases.

## First Phase: Definition of the Prototype

Each case study group will consist of four members and will have at its disposal different prototypes made in the third practical. During this first phase, the group members will have to combine the different prototypes into a new common design. The new prototype will have to be validated by the practice teacher before starting its implementation. Otherwise, the final delivery of the project will not be allowed.

## Phase Two: Prototype Implementation

The prototype designed during the first phase will be implemented using the technologies seen in the practical classes or others of each group of students' choice. Frameworks (e.g. Bootstrap) may be used, but will not be supported. In particular, it is requested to implement at least the following three pages:

- home page (with the course listing in the case of student and teacher; with an options panel in the case of administrator);
- registration / login page;
- course page (with information and content about the course with different options depending on the role, student or teacher; this page will not be implemented for the administrator role).

The cookie mechanism or localStorage is mandatory.

## Third Phase: Documentation

In addition to the design and development of the web interface, during the third phase the group will be engaged in writing a design memory including what was already written for the third practice. The following structure will be followed:

- Main objective of the web application to be designed (combining the objectives already defined in point 3 of the third practice).
- Potential users of the application (people), and study and evaluation of similar web pages, including the principles, heuristics and design patterns applied (combining points 1 and 2 of the third practice).
- Description of the prototype previously designed applying Nielsen's heuristics and Van Duyne's patterns.
- Description of the technologies used.
